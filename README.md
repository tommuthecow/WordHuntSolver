**Brief Summary:**

Word Hunt Solver is a web application designed to assist users in finding words within a grid of letters for the popular iOS game, Word Hunt. Users can input letters into a grid, and the application will then identify and display valid words that can be formed using those letters. Users are also able to login/register/logout. This program uses a custom trie data structure written in Python to efficiently validate all potential words produced by a recursive depth-first graph traversal. UI built with HTML, CSS, and JS on the front-end through React, and Node is used on the back-end.

**Features Included:**

- Frontend components and animations through React
- Backed user registration/login/logout functionality
- Full Stack linking with frontend and backend through React and Node
- Deployment wasn't possible because the dictionary information took too much memory
